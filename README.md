Honey Rae's - Client
==================
Honey Rae's Client is the client-side directory for my full-stack application Honey Rae's Repairs. It is built using React and Reactstrap styling.

The purpose of this project was to gain skills writing server-side endpoints in C#, so the client files are simple, yet clean and user-friendly.

I took advantage of the simplicity and developer-friendly Reactstrap tables, dropdowns, buttons, navigation, etc. in order to spend the majority of my time and learning efforts on the server-side portion of this project.
